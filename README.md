# ProjectEGM722v2
# Elevation Profile Creator

A python script that creates an elevation profile between 2 user specified points from a geotiff image generated from NASA earthdata

## Installation
1. To run this python script you need to install both git and conda on your computer You will need an account to access the NASA earth data and will need to create a netrc file to access NASA earthdata.
You can follow the instructions for installing git from here, and Anaconda from here.
You will need to get the files from GIMP, create an anaconda environment using the environment.yml file,  add Pycharm to the created environment and run the code in pycharm
2. Once you have these installed, clone this repository to your computer by doing one of the following things:

Open GitHub Desktop and select File > Clone Repository. Select the URL tab, then enter the URL for this repository.
Open Git Bash (from the Start menu), then navigate to your folder for this module. Now, execute the following command: git clone https://github.com/iamdonovan/egm722.git. You should see some messages about downloading/unpacking files, and the repository should be set up.
You can also clone this repository by clicking the green "clone or download" button above, and select "download ZIP" at the bottom of the menu. Once it's downloaded, unzip the file and move on to the next step. I don't recommend this step, however, as it will be more difficult for you to download the material for each week.
